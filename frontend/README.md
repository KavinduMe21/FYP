# Vercel Deployment - Frontend Only

This directory contains the frontend for the Rugby Knock-On Detector.

## Environment Variables

You'll need to set this in your Vercel project:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your Hugging Face Space URL (optional, can be set directly in the HTML)

## Deployment

The frontend will be automatically deployed to Vercel when you push to your repository.
